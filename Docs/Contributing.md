# Contributing

* First, thank you!
* Bug reports, suggestions, and code contributions are welcome!

---

Even though `YINI-spec` is still in alpha/beta. Your feedback and suggestions, and possible contributions are highly valued. 

If you find any bugs or errors in the `YINI` specification, grammar or elsewhere, feel free to add a new issue or make a PR :)

## Submitting Changes

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or other issue?

Thank you!

- Open a pull request (PR) against the `develop` branch (this is where all new code goes).
- Name the branch using one of the following prefixes:
  * `fix/` if branch is to make any fixe(s).
  * `update/` if branch is to update info or data.
  * `feature/` if branch is to add a feature. **But before that, create an issue to discuss it, so that PR is less likely to be wasted!** :)
