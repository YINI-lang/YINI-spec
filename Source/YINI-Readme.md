# YINI Specification v1.0.0 Alpha 3

is a config and settings file format (similar (but not same) to INI-files) for computer software that consists of plain text with a very simple structure and notation, comprising of Keyâ€“Value pairs and Key-List pairs, grouped in sections.

`YINI` (also `yINI` or `yini`)
## So, what is special about YINI?
In YINI:
- Strings are enclosed by either single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`, use what you prefer.
- Key-**Value** pairs are separated by an equals sign `=`.
- While, Key-**List** pairs are separated by a colon `:`.

## Trivia
### The Name
In the beginning, `YINI` started with the working name `MINI`, and then `MINI-CONFIG` / `miniCONFIG` which stood for Minimalistic INI Configuration Object Notation File. Also M stood for Marko's (after the author) at the start but was changed to stand for minimalistic. Finally, as the specification began to mature away from the draft stage, the name was renamed to just `YINI`.
