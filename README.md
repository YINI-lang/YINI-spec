# MINI
Minimalist initialization configuration file format.

---

## General Objective
MINI aims to be a simple, lightweight and text-based configuration file format, that is language-independent and platform-independent as far as possible.

It aims to be even more minimal and lightweight than similar formats. No unnecessary extra niceties (this can be taken care of by the host language if desired or needed). Yet expressive enough to store the most important data types like strings, numbers, booleans and lists in sections or nested sections.

## Design Goals
- MINI should be very easily readable by humans.
- MINI data should be portable between programming languages.
- MINI should support one-pass processing.
- MINI should be simple and lightweight.
- MINI should be easy to implement and use.
